# benchmarks-in-nested-virtualisation-toolchain

Prerequisites for running
1. Private key has to be present in ~/.ssh
2. The key has to be symlinked on multiple places, but the script complains correctly, so it is easy to fix.
3. scripts/install_components.sh has to be run once before running the main script (to save time in repeated launches)
